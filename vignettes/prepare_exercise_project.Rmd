# Disclaimer
The process of starting the development of exercises is documented.


# Background
Exercises are offered using __quarto-live__ as described at https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/


# Getting Started
The starting point is a quarto project. This was created under `inst/exercises` and named lbgfs2024. Inside that project, we follow the steps given at: https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live


# Deployment
The exercise subdirectories containing all files are copied over to the `docs` subfolder.

```bash
# copy
mkdir -p docs/exercises
cp -r inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/exercises/lbg_ex01 docs/exercises

mkdir -p inst/website/exercises
mv inst/website/lbgfs2024/exercises.qmd inst/website/lbgfs2024/exercises
# table data
EXPATHDAT=inst/website/lbgfs2024/exercises/exercises.dat
echo 'Date;Text;Filename' > $EXPATHDAT
echo '2024-09-27;Genotype Data;lbg_ex01/lbg_ex01.html' >> $EXPATHDAT

```


# Commit

```bash
for f in $(git status | grep 'new file' | tr -s ' ' ';' | cut -d ';' -f3);do
  echo " * File: $f ..."
  git commit -m"Commit $f " $f
  git push origin main
  sleep 2
done
```
