# Disclaimer
The process of starting the development of exercises is documented.


# Background
Exercises are offered using __quarto-live__ as described at https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/


# Getting Started
The starting point is a quarto project. This was created under `inst/exercises` and named lbgfs2024. Inside that project, we follow the steps given at: https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live


# Deployment
The exercise subdirectories containing all files are copied over to the `docs` subfolder.

```bash
# copy
mkdir -p docs/exercises
cp -r inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/exercises/lbg_ex01 docs/exercises

mkdir -p inst/website/exercises
mv inst/website/lbgfs2024/exercises.qmd inst/website/lbgfs2024/exercises
# table data
EXPATHDAT=inst/website/lbgfs2024/exercises/exercises.dat
echo 'Date;Text;Filename' > $EXPATHDAT
echo '2024-09-27;Genotype Data;lbg_ex01' >> $EXPATHDAT

```


# Commit

```bash
for f in $(git status | grep 'new file' | tr -s ' ' ';' | cut -d ';' -f3);do
  echo " * File: $f ..."
  git commit -m"Commit $f " $f
  git push origin main
  sleep 2
done
```

Commit and push exercise project

```bash
git add .
echo inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/_extensions >> .gitignore
for f in $(git status | grep 'new file' | tr -s ' ' ';' | cut -d ';' -f3);do
  echo " * File: $f ..."
  git commit -m "Commit $f" $f
  git push origin main
  sleep 2
done
```


# Solutions

Deployment to website

```bash
# copy
mkdir -p docs/solutions
cp -r inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol01 docs/solutions

mkdir -p inst/website/lbgfs2024/solutions
mv inst/website/lbgfs2024/solutions.qmd inst/website/lbgfs2024/solutions
rm docs/solutions.html inst/website/lbgfs2024/_site/solutions.html

# table data
SOLPATHDAT=inst/website/lbgfs2024/solutions/solutions.dat
echo 'Date;Text;Filename' > $SOLPATHDAT
echo '2024-09-27;Genotype Data;lbg_sol01' >> $SOLPATHDAT

```

Commit

```bash
git add docs/solutions
for f in $(git status | grep 'new file' | tr -s ' ' ';' | cut -d ';' -f3);do
  echo " * File: $f ..."
  git commit -m "Commit $f" $f
  git push origin main
  sleep 2
done

git add inst/website/lbgfs2024/solutions
for f in $(git status | grep 'new file' | tr -s ' ' ';' | cut -d ';' -f3);do
  echo " * File: $f ..."
  git commit -m "Commit $f" $f
  git push origin main
  sleep 2
done

```


# Solution lbg_sol02
Start with lbg_sol01 and copy it as lbg_sol02. Then complete lbg_sol02 and commit/push only the qmd-file. All the render-output is removed or ignored in order not to put it in the repo.

```bash
mkdir -p inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol02
# copy over lbg_sol01.qmd and modify it
cp inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol01/lbg_sol01.qmd inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol02/lbg_sol02.qmd
# once the final version is done, render it and then copy the result after render to the website section
cp -r inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol02 docs/solutions
rm docs/solutions/lbg_sol02/lbg_sol02.qmd

# then clean up
rm -rf inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol02/lbg_sol02_files
rm inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol02/lbg_sol02.html
```


# Exercise lbg_ex01

```bash
mkdir -p inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/exercises/lbg_ex02
# copy lbg_sol02 to lbg_ex02, then remove the solutions
cp -r inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/solutions/lbg_sol02/lbg_sol02.qmd inst/exercises/lbgfs2024/exercises/lbg_ex02/lbg_ex02.qmd
