## Problem 1: Genotype Data
Use the dataset on genotypes of animals to compute a first set of descriptive statistics of the gene-locations. The dataset is available in comma-separated format at: https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2024/data/geno_first_100.csv

* Use the function `readr::read_delim()` with the delimitor set to comma (`delim = ","`) to read the data

```{webr}
#| label: Read Data
#| min-lines: 3

```

* Use either functions `unique()` or a combination of `levels()` and `as.factor()` to determine which genotypes are available for which locus, start with the first three loci as examples

```{webr}
#| label: Unique Genotype Levels
#| min-lines: 3

```

An alternative is to use factors

```{webr}
#| label: Factor Genotype Levels
#| min-lines: 3


```

* Compute genotype frequencies using the function `table()`

```{webr}
#| label: Genotype Frequencies
#| min-lines: 3

```
