# Disclaimer
This is an experiment of how far we can get with developing the basic relationships in quantitative genetics. 


# Population Mean
Given a quantitative trait and a bi-allelic locus. Parameters for genotypic values are assumed to be $a$ and $d$ and genotype frequencies follow the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hence the population mean is given by

```{python}
import sympy as sp
# symbols
a, d, p = sp.symbols('a d p')
# population mean
mu = p**2 * a + 2*p*(1-p) * d + (1-p)**2 * (-a)
simplified_mu = sp.simplify(mu)
```

Collect terms

```{python}
collected_mu = sp.collect(simplified_mu, [a, d])
collected_mu
```

Factor out p

```{python}
factored_mu_p = sp.factor(collected_mu, p)
factored_mu_p
```
