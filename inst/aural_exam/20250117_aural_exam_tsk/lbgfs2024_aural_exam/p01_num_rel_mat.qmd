# Numerator Relationship Matrix
Given is the following pedigree

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
s_data_root <- "https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2024/data"
s_ped_p01 <- file.path(s_data_root, "aural_exam_pedigree_p01.csv")
tbl_ped_p01 <- readr::read_delim(s_ped_p01, 
                                 delim = ",", 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)
```

Pedigree shown as table

```{r}
#| echo: true
knitr::kable(tbl_ped_p01)
```


Use the above pedigree to compute 

a. the numerator relationship matrix $A$ and 
b. the inbreeding coefficients of each animal
c. the expected inbreeding coefficients of potential offspring of animal 1 when mated to all possible mates in the pedigree

Given a numerator relationship $A$, how can be determined which animals has which parents?
