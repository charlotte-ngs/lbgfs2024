## Problem 1: Sire Model
As already shown during the lecture for the small data set at

https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2024/data/small_beef_data.csv

a sire model is to be used for the following dataset, already used in Exercise 4. The data set is available from

https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2024/data/beef_data_bc.csv

The ration $\lambda_s$ between the residual variance and the sire variance can be assumed to be

$$\lambda_s = \frac{\sigma_e^2}{\sigma_s^2} = 1$$


### Solution

```{webr}
# read the data
s_beef <- 'https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2024/data/beef_data_bc.csv'
tbl_beef <- readr::read_delim(s_beef, delim = ",")
```


* Design matrix $X$

```{webr}
# design matrix X

```

* Design matrix $Z$

```{webr}
# design matrix Z

```

* Coefficient matrix of mixed model equations

```{webr}
# coefficient matrix

```

* Right-hand side of mixed model equations

```{webr}
# right-hand side

```

* Solve mixed model equations

```{webr}
# solve mme

```

* Identify estimates of fixed effects and predictions of sire effects

```{webr}
# fixed effects estimates

# predictions of sire effects

```
