## Problem 1: BLUP Animal Model
Use the data set given below to predict breeding values for the response variable `Weight` using a BLUP animal model. The model contains `Herd` as fixed effect and `BreastCircumference` as regression covariate. The heritability ($h^2$) which is the ratio between genetic variance $\sigma_u^2$ and the phenotypic variance $\sigma_y^2$ is set to $h^2 = `r n_h2_weight`$. 

```{webr}
#| message: false
#| warning: false 
#| edit: false
s_beef_dat <- "https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2024/data/beef_data_blup.csv"
tbl_beef_dat <- readr::read_delim(s_beef_dat, delim = ",")
tbl_beef_dat
```


### Task

* Set up mixed model equations
* Use package 'pedigreemm' to get inverse of matrix $A$
* Solve mixed model equations
* Get estimates for fixed effects
* Get solutions for random breeding values
* Rank animals according to predicted breeding values


### Solution 

* Set up mixed model equations. For this, we require indcidence matrices

```{webr}
# incidence matrix X

# incidence matrix Z

```

The inverse numerator relationship matrix is obtained via `pedigreemm`

```{webr}
# setup augmented version of pedigree

# get inverse of A

```


* Solve mixed model equations

```{webr}
# set up coefficient matrix of mme

# set up right-hand side of mme

# solve for unknown estimates of fixed effects and solutions for breeding values

```

* Get estimates for fixed effects

```{webr}
# identify estimates of fixed effects from above solutions

```

* Get solutions for random breeding values

```{webr}
# solutions for random breeding values

```


* Rank animals according to predicted breeding values

```{webr}
# rank animals

```
