## Digital Tools

-   Aim: Tools helpful for user reducing time required for certain task

-   Many of current projects

    -   Paper is replaced by smart phone, tablet or PC

    -   Increase of time spent for administrative tasks

## Example Projects

-   Sesam: Sensor Based Alpine Milk Production (EU Interreg B Project: 2018-2023)

-   CFIT: Video based prediction of feed intake of cows

## SESAM I

Sensor-based activity of cows

## SESAM II

Activity data used to predict behavior

## CFIT

-   Prediction of feed intake based on video data

-   See at: <https://youtu.be/XDC-C33HpEw?si=jB3-rgxHT11x-au1>

## Digital Twin I

-   Integrate all available data from a farm and from environment into a simulation system

-   Comprehensive digital twin solutions for dairy farms are still in development


## Digital Twin II

-   Companies like

    -   xFarm Technologies, in collaboration with Precision Farming Network (<https://xfarm.ag/en/blog-posts/xfarm-technologies-e-precision-farming-network-pfn-costruiscono-il-primo-digital-twin-per-attrezzature-agricole-sempre-piu-connesse-it>)

    -   FORCE Technology, in partnership with Alexandra Institute, Arla Foods, and SPX FLOW (<https://forcetechnology.com/en/cases/kold-college-digital-twin-pasteurisation-plant>)

    
## Digital Twin III

## Conclusions

-   Real benefit results only from changing systems

-   Digitalisation is not the replacement of paper by devices

-   Large projects require large financial power

-   Politics needs to be supportive
